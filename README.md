This work is on a dataset of submissions to a popular technology site called Hacker News, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit.
 - The goal is to analyze the dataset to check the number of comments received by any post at any hour of the day.
 - eventually we will be able to know what time is the likeliest time to gain traction and get the highest comment for post.
 - All times will be converted to London UK time.
